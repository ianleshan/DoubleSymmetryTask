# Double Symmetry Task
The app was built using Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile.
To run, simply import the project into Android Studio from version control and run the android app. Make sure you have the kotlin multiplatform mobile plugin installed.

I had quite a bit of fun with this task. First of all, Kotlin Multiplatform is something that I have wanted to use in the past, but never got a chance. This task was an opportunity to learn and create something using it. This technology has become one that I appreciate and will definitely use in the future given the opportunity.

It was pleasant learning other APIs. For example, the Ktor api was a worthy alternative to the Retrofit library that has been my networking api of choice.

Seeing that KMM is a relatively young technology and my lack of experience with it, identifying outdated tutorials was time consuming and hence slowed me down. But once I was able to discern up-to-date guides, my progress was back on track.

In conclusion, the task was a great learning experience and I am looking forward to your feedback.
